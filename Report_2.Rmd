```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)

```

Our hypothesis is that a linear relationship exists between number of absences (absences) and final grade (G3). More specifically, weâ€™d predict that a negative relationship exists between the two.  

Below is a plot of absences vs. final grade 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(student_por, aes(absences, G3)) + geom_point() 
```


And here is a plot of hte residuals vs. predicted.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(student_por, aes(absences, G3)) + geom_point() 
```
