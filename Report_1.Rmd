```{r}
student_both<-merge(student_mat,student_por,by=c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet"))
```

```{r}
skim(student_por)
```

Let's take a look at the distributions of grades with the following histograms. 

```{r}
ggplot(student_por, aes(x=G1)) + geom_histogram() + labs(x="First Period Grade")

ggplot(student_por, aes(x=G2)) + geom_histogram() + labs(x="Second Period Grade")

ggplot(student_por, aes(x=G3)) + geom_histogram() + labs(x="Final Grade")

```

The distributions of each grade seem to be symmetric which is to be expected with grades. What about freetime
